Recently I found that the plots generated by R don't show up in the webpage
when I `blogdown::serve_site()` locally or at netlify.app. A quick google
search gave me the following two solutions:

- Modify the file config.toml to remove the pattern `_files$` from the `ignoreFiles`
  list.
  
- Add the option `fig.path=some/folder` in `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`.

The first one is recommended by Yihui.
