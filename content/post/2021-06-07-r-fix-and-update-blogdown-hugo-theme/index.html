<p>Today, I fixed one big issue in my blog – the missing
‘google fonts’, from which I learned a lot, and I will
share here and hope the experience to help others.</p>
<div id="the-issue" class="section level2">
<h2>The issue</h2>
<p>As you will see from the two pictures below, the left
one shows the google fonts as their words (see the items
in the red loop), such as ‘chevron_right’ and ‘brightness_7’.
And the picture on the right is correct.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bad-google-fonts.png" style="width:40%;border:1px solid black" alt="bad fonts" />
<img src="/images/good-google-fonts.png" style="width:40%;border:1px solid black" alt="good fonts" /></p>
<p>For more information on “google fonts”, check <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons:chevron_left&amp;icon.query=chevron">here</a>.</p>
<p>The theme used for the blog is <em>diary</em>, and it can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/AmazingRise/hugo-theme-diary" class="uri">https://github.com/AmazingRise/hugo-theme-diary</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-fix-the-issue" class="section level2">
<h2>How to fix the issue</h2>
<div id="first-try" class="section level3">
<h3>First try</h3>
<p>First, I updated the theme using the following command:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># get into the root directory of my blog project
## create a new folder themes/diary to download the theme from github
git submodule add https://github.com/AmazingRise/hugo-theme-diary.git themes/diary
## update the theme
git submodule update --remote --merge</code></pre>
<p>This didn’t fix the problem. But since my old theme version was
downloaded two years ago, this step still helps me to have updated
theme version. The advantage of using <code>git submodule update</code>
instead of R’s <code>blogdown::install_theme()</code> is that it makes update
in future easier, simply run the second command above.</p>
</div>
<div id="second-try" class="section level3">
<h3>Second try</h3>
<p>After I examined the source code of the deployed website at
<a href="https://fortune9.netlify.app">Netlify</a> using Firefox’s <code>Inspect</code>
tool, I found that my page
can’t load a javascript file: it said ‘loadCSS is not defined’,
which is a function to load a css file from
<a href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css" class="uri">https://fonts.googleapis.com/css</a>. And this function is supposed
defined in a javascript file: ‘/js/loadCSS.js’. I noticed that
in the downloaded deployment zip file, there is no ‘loadCSS.js’,
but ‘loadcss.js’ under the folder ‘/js’, so I thought that
the filename may be changed to lowercase when deployed in Netlify
and this might causing the file not be loaded.</p>
<p>Given this, I modified the file ‘/layouts/partials/head.html’
to load the javascript file with lowercase filename, as below:</p>
<pre><code># old
&lt;script src=&quot;{{&quot;.Site.BaseURL/js/loadCSS.js&quot;}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
# new
&lt;script src=&quot;{{&quot;.Site.BaseURL/js/loadcss.js&quot;}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>However, this still didn’t work.</p>
</div>
<div id="third-try" class="section level3">
<h3>Third try</h3>
<p>Although failed in second try, I was on the right track. After
further examining the source code of deployed website,
I realized that it was trying to load ‘//js/loadCSS.js’, which
looks like an absolute path, and this is further confirmed by
noticing that the <code>baseurl</code> was set to ‘/’ in ‘config.toml’
file.</p>
<p>I finally realized that this was caused by the file
‘/layouts/partials/head.html’, which was used to override
the file in ‘/themes/diary/layouts/partials/head.html’.
However, this file was generated when I used old theme
and I added google ads code into it. In the new file
‘/themes/diary/layouts/partials/head.html’, the adding
‘/js/loadCSS.js’ statement has changed to:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;{{&quot;/js/loadCSS.js&quot; | relURL}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, it is using relative URL (more info on hugo
function relURL can be found <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/relurl/">here</a>).</p>
<p>So I deleted the overriding file ‘/layouts/partials/head.html’,
and added another file ‘/layouts/partials/extended_head.html’,
in which I put my custom code (googld ads, etc). The
‘extended_head.html’ file was the suggested file to put custom
code, avoiding editing/overriding ‘head.html’.</p>
<p>This time, I succeeded.</p>

<div id="learned-lessons" class="section level2">
<h2>Learned lessons</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When updating themes, make sure the old files in the root
folder ‘layouts’ are also updated accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>When making big changes to website, such as changing themes,
one had better use a separate github branch to make the changes, and
make a pull request to the main branch. When this pull request
is sent, Netlify will also deploy a preview. After the preview
looks good, then one can merge the request into the main branch
in github. This saves the hassles in case the change caused
big issues.</p></li>
<li><p>One can use <code>git submodules</code> to manage a git repo under another
repository, allowing updating each repo independently. This
feature makes updating the themes much easier; however, themes
update is not recommended by Yihui as new changes may not one
wants. Thus check the look of a theme before update to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Downloading the deployment from Netlify helps one understand
how a website is structured, and will provide clues in debugging
issues.</p></li>

<p>My sharing stops here today. Have fun in programming! :smile:</p>
