Today, I fixed one big issue in my blog -- the missing 
'google fonts', from which I learned a lot, and I will
share here and hope the experience to help others.

## The issue

As you will see from the two pictures below, the left
one shows the google fonts as their words (see the items
in the red loop), such as 'chevron_right' and 'brightness_7'.
And the picture on the right is correct.

![bad fonts](/images/bad-google-fonts.png){style="width:40%;border:1px solid black"}
![good fonts](/images/good-google-fonts.png){style="width:40%;border:1px solid black"}

For more information on "google fonts", check [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons:chevron_left&icon.query=chevron).

The theme used for the blog is *diary*, and it can be found at
https://github.com/AmazingRise/hugo-theme-diary.

## How to fix the issue

### First try

First, I updated the theme using the following command:

```bash
# get into the root directory of my blog project
## create a new folder themes/diary to download the theme from github
git submodule add https://github.com/AmazingRise/hugo-theme-diary.git themes/diary
## update the theme
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

This didn't fix the problem. But since my old theme version was
downloaded two years ago, this step still helps me to have updated
theme version. The advantage of using `git submodule update`
instead of R's `blogdown::install_theme()` is that it makes update
in future easier, simply run the second command above.

### Second try

After I examined the source code of the deployed website at
[Netlify](https://fortune9.netlify.app) using Firefox's `Inspect`
tool, I found that my page
can't load a javascript file: it said 'loadCSS is not defined',
which is a function to load a css file from 
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css. And this function is supposed
defined in a javascript file: '/js/loadCSS.js'. I noticed that
in the downloaded deployment zip file, there is no 'loadCSS.js',
but 'loadcss.js' under the folder '/js', so I thought that
the filename may be changed to lowercase when deployed in Netlify
and this might causing the file not be loaded.

Given this, I modified the file '/layouts/partials/head.html'
to load the javascript file with lowercase filename, as below:

```
# old
<script src="{{".Site.BaseURL/js/loadCSS.js"}}"></script>
# new
<script src="{{".Site.BaseURL/js/loadcss.js"}}"></script>
```

However, this still didn't work.

### Third try

Although failed in second try, I was on the right track. After
further examining the source code of deployed website,
I realized that it was trying to load '//js/loadCSS.js', which
looks like an absolute path, and this is further confirmed by
noticing that the `baseurl` was set to '/' in 'config.toml'
file.

I finally realized that this was caused by the file
'/layouts/partials/head.html', which was used to override
the file in '/themes/diary/layouts/partials/head.html'.
However, this file was generated when I used old theme
and I added google ads code into it. In the new file
'/themes/diary/layouts/partials/head.html', the adding
'/js/loadCSS.js' statement has changed to:

```
<script src="{{"/js/loadCSS.js" | relURL}}"></script>
```

Obviously, it is using relative URL (more info on hugo
function relURL can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/functions/relurl/)).

So I deleted the overriding file '/layouts/partials/head.html',
and added another file '/layouts/partials/extended_head.html',
in which I put my custom code (googld ads, etc). The
'extended_head.html' file was the suggested file to put custom
code, avoiding editing/overriding 'head.html'.

This time, I succeeded.

## Learned lessons

1. When updating themes, make sure the old files in the root
  folder 'layouts' are also updated accordingly.
  
2. When making big changes to website, such as changing themes,
  one had better use a separate github branch to make the changes, and
  make a pull request to the main branch. When this pull request
  is sent, Netlify will also deploy a preview. After the preview
  looks good, then one can merge the request into the main branch
  in github. This saves the hassles in case the change caused
  big issues.

3. One can use `git submodules` to manage a git repo under another
  repository, allowing updating each repo independently. This
  feature makes updating the themes much easier; however, themes
  update is not recommended by Yihui as new changes may not one
  wants. Thus check the look of a theme before update to it.

4. Downloading the deployment from Netlify helps one understand
  how a website is structured, and will provide clues in debugging
  issues.
