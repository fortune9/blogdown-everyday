I have been using opensource [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
to handle my office documents, which is convenient and free.

Today, I found one trick for shrinking documents when printing in order
to print it in one page. More specifically, I was working on an excel sheet,
which is opened with the *Calc* app of LibreOffice.

To do so, one just need to open the excel file, and then choose
*File* -> *Print Preview*, and can see the menu in the following screenshot.

With this menu, one can scale the sheet so that it can fit into one
page, and at the same time, one can click the *margins* button (the little
rectangle with margin lines) next to the word *Scale* and adjust the margins.
After adjusting, one can click print button to print the document.

I hope that this helps.

Happy 2025, everyone!
