Very exciting: my software [CUA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::CUA) is cited by a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.039)
published at Cell Reports. This is very encouraging for
me to further improve the software. 

My paper describes the software was published at [BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/022814). You can
also find documentation (including a tutorial) at [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::CUA).

Recently, more and more studies show that codon usage
is, in addition to translation, relevant to mRNA stability, transcription, etc, making the observation
of codon usage bias in many genomes more mysterious. I wish
that my software will help researchers in unveil the mystery.

Have a nice day!
