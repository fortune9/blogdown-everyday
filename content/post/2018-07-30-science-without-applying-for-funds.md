Nowdays, scientific research is often done at institutions
such as universities and companies.

A fact is that research often costs a lot of money and research
results mostly don't generate profit. Therefore, researchers
often suffer the lack of research funds, especially
recent years.

I often ponder how research can be sustainable and whether
one can do research with applying for funds.

I happened to find [Dr. Robert C. Edgar](https://www.drive5.com/resume.html)'s
web page today when I search literature. His experience is astounding: he earned Ph.D,
founded business, and now is an *independent* scientist.
His programs such as MUSCLE and USEARCH have made a huge
impact in computational biology.

I like this mode of research -- independent research
without attaching to an institution. With fast growing
data in all fields, it is possible that one day scientists
will be retail vendors for solving problems and use
profit to support more research -- a sustainable mode. Wow!!
