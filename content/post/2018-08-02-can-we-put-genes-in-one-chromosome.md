Organisms often have more than one chromosomes to carry their
genetic materials such as genes. For example, a human
individual has 23 pairs of different chromosomes, and a
baking yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)
has 16 different chromosomes when in haploid status.

Why do an organism have many chromosomes other than one?
Particularly, if one thinks that only genes on chromosomes
are useful and the rest may be [junk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA#Junk_DNA),
he may think that putting all genes in a chromosome will be
completely fine and this is more efficient in saving
energy of synthesizing "useless" portions of chromosomes.

Excitingly, recently two studies published by [Shao, et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0382-x)
and [Luo, et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0374-x)
demonstrates that reducing the number of chromosomes in the
yeast is almostly fine: the yeast with only one chromosome
by fusing all the 16 chromosomes grew as well as a wild-type
16-chromosome yeast. Also hybridzing the strains with
different chromosome numbers basically produced inviable
spores -- productive isolation.

This is really an exciting progress that we can, for the
first time, show how an organism with only one chromosome
behaves. It also triggers several questions for me:

1. What happens if applying the same approach to organisms
with larger chromosomes? The total size of the yeast is 12Mb, much smaller than the smallest human chromosome (Y, 57.2Mb).

2. Why are single-chromosome organims not observed in nature? 
This may be related to natural selection process -- a
slight decrease in growth can have significant effect on
the competion of the organism with others in nature.

Look forward to more advances!
