## Background

As a computational biologist with 20 years of experience, I have conducted research across a broad spectrum of topics, including:

- Cancer genomics and diagnostic methods
- Gene expression regulation and dosage compensation
- DNA methylation
- Comparative and evolutionary genomics
- Origins of COVID-19 viruses
    
    
The publications for these studies can be found at
[Google scholar](https://tinyurl.com/3j98f5m8).

Throughout my research career, I have developed a versatile set of technical skills, including:

- Programming: R, Python, Perl, Linux/Bash, nextflow, and more
- Data visualization: RMarkdown, Shiny, Flexdashboard, streamlit, etc.
- Statistical analysis: inference, hypothesis testing
- Machine learning: SVM, random forests, neural networks, generative AI
- Phylogenetics: constructing and analyzing phylogenetic gene trees

    
## Why to make this website

In my daily work, I've tackled numerous technical challenges and continually expanded my knowledge. I've created this website to **share** what I've learned and the solutions I've found, in hopes that they may assist others.

I'm grateful for the internet as a platform for both learning and sharing, enabling people from all backgrounds to benefit from the collective wisdom of the online community.
