## Background

As a computational biologist, I have amassed 18 years of experience
in the field, working on a diverse range of research topics including

- gene expression regulation
- DNA methylation
- dosage compensation
- comparative and evolutionary genomics
- cancer genomics
- origin of covid-19 viruses

The publications for these studies can be found at
[Google scholar](https://tinyurl.com/3j98f5m8).

Over the course of my research, I have developed a comprehensive
set of technical skills, including:

- programming, such as R, Python, Perl, Linux/bash, etc
- visualization, such as Rmarkdown, shiny, flexdashboard, etc
- statistics, such as inference, hypothesis testing
- machine learning, such as SVM, random forest, neural networks
- phylogeny, such as phylogenetic gene trees

## Why to make this website

In the course of my daily work, I have encountered numerous
technical problems and have had the opportunity to learn new things.
As a result, I have created this website to **share** my knowledge
and solutions in the hopes that they may be of assistance to others.

I am grateful that the internet provides a platform for both learning
and sharing, enabling individuals from all walks of life to benefit
from the collective knowledge of the online community.
